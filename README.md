Social Proof Section

This project is a solution to the Frontend Mentor Social Proof Section challenge. The aim was to create a visually appealing and responsive social proof section using HTML and CSS. The section includes a header, user ratings, and customer reviews, providing a comprehensive overview of user satisfaction with the products and services.

## The design features

- A main header highlighting the high number of satisfied users.
- Three rating sections, each with five-star ratings from different sources.
- Three customer review cards, each with a profile picture, name, verification status, and a testimonial.

The project utilizes semantic HTML5 for structure and CSS for styling, including Flexbox for layout. Google Fonts were used for typography, ensuring a clean and modern look. This project serves as a practical example of creating a user-focused testimonial section, showcasing design skills and attention to detail.
